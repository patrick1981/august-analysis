Our conversation began with your request to get your modular SilentStacks v2.0 project running for security and performance testing, highlighting past difficulties with other AI models.

I confirmed my understanding of your project's architecture and identified initial issues, including missing core infrastructure and potential security vulnerabilities. I then provided a solution to implement the foundational modules and apply security patches.

Following this, you pointed out a critical package.json error preventing the project from running, which I resolved by creating the necessary file.

Most recently, you identified eight specific features that were missing from the current implementation, such as bulk upload with data enrichment, clinical trials integration, an integrated help tab, proper search and sort functionality, PMID/CrossRef metadata integration with PubMed priority, and NLM citation styling. I have since provided a comprehensive update, implementing all these features to bring the application to your desired state for testing.
