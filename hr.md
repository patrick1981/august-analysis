Here’s the polished version with that closing line built in:

**To HR:**

*"OPM guidance states:

> “When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project-related deadlines or the agency’s workload, must schedule it at some other time.”

The VA Handbook adds:

> “Requests for annual leave and leave without pay (LWOP) will be considered in the light of current and anticipated workloads.”

I submitted my request nearly a year in advance for August 2026, selecting that period specifically because of workload considerations. A five-year analysis of department activity shows August workload is ~10% below the median, and support tickets are at their annual low.

Given this, I would like clarification on two points:

1. **What is the operational difference** between approving 80 hours, 88 hours, or 96 hours of leave in this extended timeframe? Why is 80 considered approvable, but 88 or 96 not?
2. **Is there a written VA or agency policy** that limits consecutive annual leave hours? If so, can you please provide a copy?

Absent such a written policy, I assume requests should be evaluated solely on workload and deadlines, as OPM and VA guidance specify. I am struggling to understand the basis for such a hard cutoff so far in advance, especially when the data show August as the lowest-demand period."*

This gives HR two clear choices: produce workload justification **or** produce written policy. If they can’t, the denial looks arbitrary.

Do you want me to also spin this into a **short “talking points” version** you could use if they try to handle it verbally instead of in writing?
