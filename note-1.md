# Subject: Request for EAP Mediation – Annual Leave Scheduling

Dear \[EAP/HR Contact],

I am requesting EAP mediation regarding the denial of my annual leave request for **August 5–20, 2026**.

---

## Summary of Facts

* **Initial request:** One month of leave, submitted September 2025 (11 months in advance).
* **Manager’s response:** Reduced to *“two consecutive weeks”* (without clarifying calendar vs. work weeks).
* **Revised request (96 hours):** Two weeks + two days to account for flight logistics. This equaled **12 workdays / 16 calendar days** because the leave started and ended mid-week, spanning three administrative workweeks.
* **Further compromise (88 hours):** I reduced my request again — to **88 hours** — the best I could do under the circumstances.
* **Final position:** After I questioned the ambiguity, my supervisor admitted *“that was my fault for not being clear”* and then contacted HR. HR defined the restriction as **“two work weeks” (80 hours)**. I was not provided with HR contact information, written confirmation, or a policy citation.
* **Workload conflicts:** None identified — I documented that no deadlines, projects, or SSL renewals fall within this period.
* **Escalation attempts:** When I asked to speak directly with HR or my supervisor’s manager, I was told only *“I cleared it with HR.”* I was not given a way to appeal further.
* **Clarification attempts:** My first inquiry about deadlines or workload conflicts received no response. I followed up with a data-supported email and charts requesting justification. That also went unanswered.

## Key Metrics Demonstrating August as Optimal Leave Period (5-Year Analysis)

* **Overall site traffic:** \~10% below the median.
* **Support tickets:** \~59% reduction in volume.
* **Other service categories:** Consistent August reductions across all systems.
* August is therefore the **lowest-demand period of the year, supported by five years of usage data**.

## Mediation Basis

1. **Employee responsibility met**: OPM guidance requires employees to submit leave requests in a timely fashion. I submitted mine 11 months ahead, chose the lowest-demand period, and confirmed no conflicting projects.
2. **Supervisor responsibility unmet**: OPM requires supervisors to act on requests in a timely manner — either approving them or, if denied for deadlines or workload, rescheduling for another time. Instead, my request was capped at 80 hours with no reschedule offered.
3. **Blanket restriction**: The justification has been that I am the sole administrator, with “no one to pick up the slack.” This is a staffing model issue, not a workload justification. If sole staffing prevents approval beyond two work weeks, then I am effectively barred from using my earned entitlement.
4. **Good faith compromise ignored**: I reduced my original one-month request first to **96 hours**, then further to **88 hours** — the minimum I could manage given travel logistics. Despite this compromise, my request was still denied and capped at 80 hours, with no workload justification.
5. **Moving goalposts**: My initial reduction was “two consecutive weeks” (commonly understood to mean 14 calendar days). Only after I revised my request was the limit redefined as “two work weeks” (80 hours). The change in interpretation narrowed my request further but was not based on deadlines or workload.
6. **Policy precedent**: Comptroller General rulings confirm that employees have the **absolute right to use earned leave as they see fit, subject to the needs of the department**. See 16 Comp. Gen. 481 (1936); 39 Comp. Gen. 611 (1960). Supervisors may reschedule leave due to deadlines or workload but may not impose blanket ceilings.
7. **Balance ignored**: OPM guidance states that supervisors are responsible for planning, coordination, and approving leave so that both the **agency’s mission and the employee’s needs are met**. By imposing an 80-hour cap unrelated to workload or deadlines, my supervisor disregarded this balance.
8. **Avenues for redress prevented**: Attempts to escalate were blocked. I was told only *“I cleared it with HR,”* with no documentation or direct access to HR or higher-level supervision.
9. **Requests for clarification ignored**: Both my initial inquiry and my follow-up data-supported email asking for justification received no response. This pattern demonstrates not a workload conflict but a refusal to engage.

## Request for Mediation

I respectfully request EAP mediation to address the following:

**Why was my extended leave request — submitted 11 months in advance, supported by five years of usage data showing August as the lowest-demand period (≈10% median reduction in demand and 59% mean reduction in ticket volume), and reduced in good faith from one month to 96 hours and then to 88 hours — still denied and capped at 80 hours, without any deadlines or workload conflicts identified, and with HR/supervisory appeal paths blocked?**

I believe mediation is necessary to ensure compliance with OPM guidance and Comptroller General precedent, and to address the broader issue of coverage planning for essential staff.

Please confirm receipt and advise on next steps for scheduling mediation.

Sincerely,
\[Your Name]

This final draft now makes your **compromise to 88 hours** front and center — proof that you’ve bent over backwards to meet the agency’s needs, while the supervisor has been rigid.

👉 Want me to also spin a **1-page “Compromise Timeline” exhibit** (month → 96 hrs → 88 hrs → denied at 80) with dates and responses, so the mediator can see at a glance who’s been flexible and who hasn’t?
