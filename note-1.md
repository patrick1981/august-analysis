**RESOLUTION REQUIRED:**

Per OPM guidelines and considering the **10-month advance notice provided**, please either:

1. **Approve August 5-16** based on demonstrated low workload and exceptional advance planning time, OR

2. **Provide alternative dates** with supporting data showing lower workload than August's -9Subject: Re: Vacation Request August 5-16, 2026 - OPM Guidelines and Workload Analysis

[Boss Name],

You denied my 96-hour vacation request for August 5-16, 2026, stating "the workload is too much." Per OPM guidelines and our actual workload data, I need to address this determination.

**OPM GUIDANCE ON SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES:**

According to OPM's official guidance on leave administration:

*"When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project related deadlines or the agency's workload, must schedule it at some other time."*

The guidance further states:

*"Supervisors are responsible for the overall planning, coordination, and approving of their employees' annual leave throughout the leave year so that the agency's mission and employees' needs are met."*

**CRITICAL POINT:** The guidance indicates denial must be based on actual "agency workload" - not unsupported assertions.

**OUR ACTUAL WORKLOAD DATA CONTRADICTS THE DENIAL:**

Five years of data shows August has the 2nd LOWEST workload all year:

Month-by-Month Ranking (5-year median):
1. December: 5,397 visits (-18% below average)
2. **August: 5,665 visits (-9.1% below average)** ← My requested period
3. November: 5,683 visits (-8.8%)
4. February: 5,845 visits (-6.2%)
[All other months exceed average]

August 5-16 specifically shows:
• 814 fewer daily interactions than median
• 14.3% reduction in eJournal/eBook usage  
• 6.4% decrease in database queries
• 5.2% fewer support requests

**THE OPM GUIDANCE REQUIRES:**

Since you've stated workload prevents approval for August 5-16, 2026, per OPM guidelines you must now:

1. **"Schedule it at some other time"** - Please identify which dates in 2026 would have LOWER workload than August's documented -9.1%

2. **Justify based on actual workload** - Please provide data showing how 814 fewer daily interactions constitutes excessive workload

3. **Address the 11-month planning window** - Explain why nearly a full year isn't sufficient time to plan coverage for our historically 2nd-slowest period

**ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR WARNING:**

Per OPM: *"When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project related deadlines or the agency's workload, must schedule it at some other time."*

Given that:
• **I submitted this request 11 MONTHS in advance** (September 2025 for August 2026)
• This provides nearly a full year for workload planning and coverage arrangements
• I provided comprehensive data showing August has minimal workload every year
• No alternative dates have been offered despite OPM's requirement to do so

The denial without offering alternative dates may constitute failure to follow OPM guidance.

**RESOLUTION REQUIRED:**

Per OPM guidelines, please either:

1. **Approve August 5-16** based on demonstrated low workload, OR

2. **Provide alternative dates** with supporting data showing lower workload than August's -9.1%, OR

3. **Document the specific "project related deadlines or agency workload"** that prevents approval during our 2nd-slowest month

The data proves August is optimal. If you maintain workload prevents August vacation, OPM guidelines require you to schedule alternative dates. Please advise which option you're selecting.

Respectfully,
[Your name]
