**OPM GUIDANCE ON SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES:**

According to OPM's official guidance on leave administration:

*"When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project related deadlines or the agency's workload, must schedule it at some other time."*

The guidance further states:

*"Supervisors are responsible for the overall planning, coordination, and approving of their employees' annual leave throughout the leave year so that the agency's mission and employees' needs are met."*

**CRITICAL POINT:** The guidance indicates denial must be based on actual "agency workload" - not unsupported assertions.

**OUR LibGuides DATA CONTRADICTS THE DENIAL:**

Five years of data shows August has the 2nd LOWEST site traffic all year:

Month-by-Month Ranking (5-year median):
1. December: 5,397 visits (-18% below average)
2. **August: 5,665 visits (-9.1% below average)** ← My requested period
3. November: 5,683 visits (-8.8%)
4. February: 5,845 visits (-6.2%)
[All other months exceed average]

August 5-16 specifically shows:
• 814 fewer daily visits than median.
• 14.3% reduction in A-Z list usage.
• 6.4% decrease in database page usage.
• 5.2% fewer support Ask A librarian tickets.

**THE OPM GUIDANCE REQUIRES:**

Since you've stated workload prevents approval for August 5-19, 2026, per OPM guidelines you must now:

1. **"Schedule it at some other time"** - Please identify which dates in 2026 would have LOWER workload than August's documented -9.1%.

2. **Justify based on actual workload** - Please provide data showing how 814 fewer daily interactions constitutes excessive workload.

3. **Address the 11-month planning window** - Explain why nearly a full year isn't sufficient time to plan coverage for our historically 2nd-slowest period.


Given that:
• **I submitted this request 11 MONTHS in advance** (September 2025 for August 2026)
• This provides nearly a full year for workload planning and coverage arrangements
• I provided comprehensive data showing August has minimal workload every year
• No alternative dates have been offered despite OPM's requirement to do so


**RESOLUTION REQUIRED:**

Per OPM guidelines, please either:

1. **Approve August 5-19** based on demonstrated low workload, OR

2. **Provide alternative dates** with supporting data showing lower workload than August's -9.1%, OR

3. **Document the specific "project related deadlines or agency workload"** that prevents approval during our 2nd-slowest month with a 10 month planning window.

The data proves August is optimal for a 14 day vacation.

Respectfully,
