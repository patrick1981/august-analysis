# August Workload Analysis (2020â€“2025)

**Purpose:** To demonstrate that August is historically a low-workload month across all library systems, supporting a vacation request for August 2026.

## Key Findings
- **Mean of Medians** (robust metric):
  - **August = 669 visits/page**
  - **December = 635 visits/page (lowest)**
  - **March = 754 visits/page (highest)**
- August is **2nd lowest month overall** across 5 years.
- August 2025 had the **lowest August traffic on record** (7,389 total visits).
- Results consistent under multiple methods (totals, averages, medians, mean-of-means).

## Charts
- Seasonal pattern chart highlights August in the **lower tier** every year.
- Historical August totals show 2025 as the lowest.
- Documentation included for reproducibility.

## Methods
- See `analysis/01_methods.md` for step-by-step explanation.
- Transparent calculations, no approximations.
- Code available to reproduce in Python/Excel/Power Query.

## Bottom Line
> **August is historically the 2nd slowest month.**
>  
> Denying vacation in August on the grounds of workload contradicts 5 years of data.
