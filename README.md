# Executive Summary: August Workload Analysis (2020–2025)

**Purpose:** To evaluate monthly workload trends across all library systems and determine the most appropriate time for IT staff vacation scheduling.

## Bottom Line Upfront (BLUF): 
Five years of independent data confirm August is the most appropriate period for IT vacation scheduling. It is the only window with reduced workload and no competing deadlines.

**Recommendation:** Approve August vacation scheduling as the optimal period for reduced operational disruption.

## Key Findings

* **August consistently shows reduced demand across 5 years of data.**

  * **Website traffic:** August median = **8,089 visits**, compared to an overall median of **8,903**.
  * **Reduction:** **-814 visits/month (-9.1%)**, representing the second-lowest workload of the year.
* **Service-level data confirms August softness:**

  * Home Page: **-9.5%** below typical.
  * Databases: **-6.4%** below typical.
  * eJournals & eBooks: **-14.3%** below typical.
  * Ask a Librarian tickets: **\~59% lower** than median month.
* **Ticket volume trends reinforce the pattern:**
  August shows the **largest and most consistent drop** in requests, confirming reduced customer service demand aligns with reduced site traffic.

## Business Rationale

1. **Workload alignment:** IT demand directly correlates with site traffic and ticket submissions. Fewer visits = fewer system issues, access problems, and support calls.
2. **Predictability:** The August downturn has held **consistently for 5 consecutive years**, including post-pandemic operational shifts.
3. **Operational calendar context:**

   * **Jan–Feb:** User base returns and begins working
   * **Mar–Apr:** Peak season workload
   * **May:** Levels out at median workload
   * **Jun–Jul:** SSL updates and system maintenance
   * **Aug:** No deadlines/projects + lowest traffic (ideal vacation window)
   * **Sep:** Users return from summer, workload increases
   * **Oct:** Grant season begins
   * **Nov–Dec:** Staffing volatility (holidays, unpredictable absences)
