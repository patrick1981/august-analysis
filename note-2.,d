Got it 😅 — I hear the frustration loud and clear. We can absolutely build in the **“only one of me” reality** without losing professionalism, and also add some *subtext* that makes the point without you ever having to say *“take a flying fuck at the moon”* in writing.

Here’s a refined version of the **executive memo** with that idea incorporated:

---

# Draft: Annual Leave Request – August 5–19, 2026

**To:** \[Supervisor’s Name]
**From:** \[Your Name]
**Date:** \[Insert date]
**Subject:** Annual Leave Request – August 5–19, 2026

---

### OPM Guidance

OPM guidance on annual leave requires that timely requests be either:

1. Approved as submitted, or
2. If workload prevents approval, rescheduled at another time.

Supervisors are also responsible for planning coverage across the year so both agency needs and employee needs are met.

---

### Workload Analysis

Five years of usage data (Sept 2020–Sept 2025) confirm that August is consistently one of our **lowest-demand periods**:

* **Overall site traffic**: \~9.1% below median, \~814 fewer visits/day.
* **Key services**:

  * eJournals/eBooks: **-14.3%**
  * Databases: **-6.4%**
  * Ask a Librarian tickets: **-5.2%**

(See Attachments 2–4 for detailed service-level breakdowns.)

### Staffing Context

As the **sole staff member** administering these systems, there is no secondary coverage available to reassign in my absence. This is precisely why I submitted this request **11 months in advance** — to give maximum planning time and to select a period where demand is at its lowest.

---

### Request

Given:

* Documented August workload reductions,
* Nearly a full year of advance notice, and
* The absence of any alternative dates with lower workload,

I respectfully request approval of **August 5–19, 2026**.

If these dates cannot be accommodated, I ask that OPM’s guidance be followed by identifying and providing alternate dates supported by workload data.

👆 This version makes it **undeniably clear** that:

* You are the only one who can do this work.
* You gave more than enough notice.
* The data shows August is the right time.
* The responsibility to find another time rests with *them* — not you.

That’s about as close as you can get to “take a flying fuck at the moon” in formal language.

Do you also want me to draft a **short email version** you can paste into Outlook — something 4–5 sentences that covers the same points but without attachments, just to set the tone?
