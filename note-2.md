Here’s the **updated EAP mediation notice** with your new stance (“my original month is back on the table”) woven in—kept tight, professional, and policy-anchored.

# Subject: Request for EAP Mediation – Annual Leave Scheduling

Dear \[EAP/HR Contact],

I am requesting EAP mediation regarding the handling of my annual leave request for **August 5–20, 2026**.

---

## Summary of Facts

* **Request submitted:** September 15, 2025 (11 months in advance)
* **Initial response:** Reduced to “two consecutive weeks” (no clarification provided)
* **Revised request:** 96 hours (≈12 workdays)
* **Further compromise:** Reduced to **88 hours** (minimum needed for international travel)
* **Supervisor response:** Indicated by email that **80 hours** would be approved; however, no official system approval has been issued and the **88-hour request remains pending** for 1.5 pay periods without action
* **Policy inquiry:** September 19, 2025 email seeking the policy basis for an 80-hour limit and any August 2026 workload conflicts **remains unanswered**
* **No departmental policy:** There is **no written departmental procedure** governing extended absences
* **Current status:** The 88-hour accommodation request is **pending** with no approval, denial, or alternate dates offered

---

## Key Data (5-Year Analysis)

* **Site traffic:** \~10% below median usage
* **Support tickets:** \~59% reduction (≈207 fewer vs. \~350 average)
* **August:** Consistently the **lowest operational demand** period annually

## OPM Guidance Requirements (and Noncompliance)

OPM states: *“When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project-related deadlines or the agency’s workload, must schedule it at some other time.”*

Failures to comply:

1. **No timely action:** 88-hour request pending 1.5 pay periods
2. **No alternative scheduling offered** when initial dates purportedly cannot be approved
3. **No documented workload justification:** August data show substantially reduced demand
4. **No project deadlines identified** despite direct inquiry
5. **Arbitrary 80-hour ceiling:** No written departmental policy supports such a cap

---

## Additional Concerns

* **Shifting definitions:** “Two consecutive weeks” → “two business weeks” → **“80 hours”** after HR consultation
* **Blanket rationale:** “Sole staff / no coverage” is a **staffing model** issue, not a valid workload basis under OPM
* **Compromise ignored:** I reduced from **one month → 96 hours → 88 hours**; the good-faith 88-hour request remains unanswered
* **Precedent:** Comptroller General (16 Comp. Gen. 481; 39 Comp. Gen. 611) affirms the **absolute right to use earned leave as the employee sees fit, subject to the needs of the department**. Blanket ceilings are inconsistent with this standard.

## Request for Mediation

I request mediation to resolve why my leave request—submitted 11 months in advance during the documented lowest-demand period, **reduced twice in good faith**, and with “80 hours” only acknowledged by email—remains pending without workload-based justification and without any alternative scheduling, as OPM requires.

**Specific Questions for Resolution**

* What written policy establishes an **80-hour** ceiling on consecutive leave?
* How does an **8-hour** difference (approved 80 vs. requested 88) materially affect operations when August shows a \~59% reduction in support tickets and \~10% lower usage overall?
* Why has **no reschedule** been offered, as mandated by OPM, if the specific dates are claimed to be infeasible?

**Good-Faith Position / Next Step**
I have accommodated repeatedly. If the 88-hour compromise will not be approved or rescheduled in compliance with OPM, then I ask that my **original one-month request** be placed back on the table for consideration, with any specific workload-based rescheduling proposed in writing.

Sincerely,
\[Your Name]
