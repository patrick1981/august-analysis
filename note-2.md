### OPM Guidance

OPM guidance on annual leave requires that timely requests be either:

1. Approved as submitted, or
2. If workload prevents approval, rescheduled at another time.

Supervisors are also responsible for planning coverage across the year so both agency needs and employee needs are met.

### Workload Analysis

Five years of usage data (Sept 2020–Sept 2025) confirm that August is consistently one of our **lowest-demand periods**:

* **Overall site traffic**: \~9.1% below median usage
* **Key services**:
• 814 fewer visits than median.
• 14.3% reduction in A-Z list usage.
• 6.4% decrease in database page usage.
• 5.2% fewer support Ask A librarian tickets.

### Staffing Context

As the **sole staff member** administering these systems, there is no secondary coverage available to reassign in my absence. This is precisely why I submitted this request **11 months in advance** — to give maximum planning time and to select a period where demand is at its lowest.

**THE OPM GUIDANCE REQUIRES:**

Since you've stated workload prevents approval for August 5-20, 2026, per OPM guidelines you must now:

1. **"Schedule it at some other time"** - Please identify which dates in 2026 would have LOWER workload than August's documented -9.1%.

2. **Justify based on actual workload** - Please provide data showing how 814 fewer daily interactions constitutes excessive workload.

3. **Address the 11-month planning window** - Explain why nearly a full year isn't sufficient time to plan coverage for our historically 2nd-slowest period.


Given that:
• **I submitted this request 11 MONTHS in advance** (September 2025 for August 2026)
• This provides nearly a full year for workload planning and coverage arrangements
• I provided comprehensive data showing August has minimal workload every year

Please either:

1. **Approve August 5-20** based on demonstrated low workload, OR
   
2. **Document the specific "project related deadlines or workload"** that prevents approval during our 2nd-slowest month with a 11 month planning window.
