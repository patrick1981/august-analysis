# Subject: Request for EAP Mediation – Annual Leave Scheduling

Dear [EAP/HR Contact],

I am requesting EAP mediation regarding the handling of my annual leave request for **August 5–20, 2026**.

---

## Summary of Facts
- **Request submitted:** September 15, 2025 (11 months in advance)  
- **Initial response:** Reduced to *“two consecutive weeks”* (no clarification provided)  
- **Revised request:** 96 hours (≈12 workdays)  
- **Further compromise:** Reduced to **88 hours** (minimum needed for international travel)  
- **Supervisor response:** Indicated by email that 80 hours would be approved, but no official approval entered into the system; the 88-hour request remains pending for 1.5 pay periods  
- **Policy inquiry:** September 19, 2025 email asking for justification of an 80-hour ceiling and clarification of August 2026 workload conflicts remains unanswered  
- **No departmental policy:** There is no written departmental procedure governing extended absences  
- **Current status:** The 88-hour request remains pending with no approval, denial, or alternative dates offered

## Key Data (5-Year Analysis)
- **Site traffic:** ~10% below median usage  
- **Support tickets:** ~59% reduction (~207 fewer vs. ~350 average)  
- **August consistently:** Lowest operational demand period annually

## Policy Requirements and Noncompliance

**OPM Guidance – Annual Leave:**  
> *“When an employee makes a timely request for leave, the supervisor must either approve the request and schedule the leave at the time requested by the employee or, if that is not possible because of project-related deadlines or the agency’s workload, must schedule it at some other time.”*  

**VA Handbook 5011, Part III, Ch. 2, Sec. 3(a):**  
> *“Requests for annual leave … will be considered in the light of current and anticipated workloads. Employees should be encouraged to take annual leave for at least 2 consecutive weeks each year for purposes of rest and relaxation; and afforded the opportunity to use their annual leave to avoid leave forfeitures.”*  

**Comptroller General Precedent:**  
> *Employees have the absolute right to use earned leave as they see fit, subject only to the needs of the service.* (16 Comp. Gen. 481; 39 Comp. Gen. 611)  

**Violations in this case:**  
1. **No timely action:** 88-hour request has been pending for 1.5 pay periods.  
2. **No reschedule offered:** Required when initial dates cannot be approved.  
3. **No workload justification:** 5-year data shows reduced demand in August.  
4. **No deadlines cited:** Direct inquiry about August 2026 conflicts unanswered.  
5. **Arbitrary 80-hour ceiling:** No written VA or departmental policy supports this.  
6. **Policy conflict:** VA Handbook encourages employees to take *two consecutive weeks* of leave annually; my request was consistent with this expectation.

## Additional Concerns
- **Shifting definitions:** “Two consecutive weeks” → “two business weeks” → “80 hours,” following HR consultation  
- **Blanket rationale:** “Sole staff / no coverage” reflects a staffing model issue, not a legitimate workload basis  
- **Good faith compromise ignored:** Reduced from **one month → 96 hours → 88 hours**, yet left unanswered  
- **Avoidance tactic:** 80 hours “approved” via email only, with no formal action in the leave system

## Request for Mediation
I request mediation to resolve why my leave request — submitted 11 months in advance, supported by five years of workload data, and reduced twice in good faith — remains pending and capped informally at 80 hours, without written policy basis, workload justification, or rescheduling, contrary to both OPM and VA Handbook 5011 requirements.  

**Specific Questions for Resolution:**  
- What written VA or departmental policy establishes an 80-hour ceiling on leave requests?  
- How does the difference between 96 hours requested and 80 hours “approved” materially affect operations during August, given documented reductions in workload?  
- Why has no alternative scheduling been offered, as required by OPM?  
- Why is an email acknowledgment being used in place of an official system approval or denial?  
- **Operational justification:** Operationally, what is the difference between the 96 hours the employee requested and the 80 hours the supervisor has indicated a willingness to approve?  

**Good-Faith Position:** I compromised twice. If my 88-hour accommodation is not acted upon in compliance with OPM and VA policy, then my **original one-month request** should be reconsidered, with any specific workload-based adjustments proposed in writing.
