## VACATION TIMING JUSTIFICATION

### Why Early August is Optimal:

1. **Quantifiable Impact Reduction**
   - 9.1% overall traffic decrease vs. median

   - 814 fewer visits to manage on average

2. **Predictable Pattern**
   - Consistent August dip for 5+ years
   - Not an anomaly but established seasonal trend
   - Pattern holds across all major service categories

3. **Service Areas Least Affected**
   - Library Catalogs actually slightly increase (+2%)
   - Basic reference services remain stable
   - Critical services maintain baseline coverage

## RECOMMENDATION

Analysis of site-wide traffic (all 14 pages, September 2020–September 2025) shows that August pages combined have a median of 8,089 visits, compared to 8,903 for a typical month — a 9.1% decrease. Recent years show a steady drop in absolute numbers. Based on this history, the forecast for August 2026–2030 suggests a base case of roughly 9,960 visits/month, with worst-case scenarios dipping into the ~7,400 range.

Therefore, early August (4-19) continues to represent the lowest-impact window for staff vacations, minimizing workload while preserving service across critical areas.
