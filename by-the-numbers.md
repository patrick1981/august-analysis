## VACATION TIMING JUSTIFICATION

### Why Early August is Optimal:

1. **Quantifiable Impact Reduction**
   - 9.1% overall traffic decrease vs. median
   - Core academic resources (eJournals, Databases) down 10-14%
   - 814 fewer visits to manage on average

2. **Predictable Pattern**
   - Consistent August dip for 5+ years
   - Not an anomaly but established seasonal trend
   - Pattern holds across all major service categories

3. **Service Areas Least Affected**
   - Library Catalogs actually slightly increase (+2%)
   - Basic reference services remain stable
   - Critical services maintain baseline coverage

## RECOMMENDATION

Based on comprehensive traffic analysis across all library services:

**Early August (August 4-19) represents the optimal vacation window with:**
- Predictable 9-10% traffic reduction
- Minimal impact on critical services
- Historical pattern consistency over 5 years
- Natural alignment with academic calendar

The data strongly supports this timing as causing the least disruption to library operations and user services.
